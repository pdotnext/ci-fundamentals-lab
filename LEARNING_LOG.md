# Learning Log — CI/CD Mastery Journey

## Day 1 — [21-02-2026]

**Concept studied:** Git as a pipeline event system. The trigger contract. Conventional Commits.

**What I built:** Project scaffolding for ci-fundamentals-lab. Python app with 4 passing tests. Branch protection on main.

**Key insight:** Git is not just version control — it is the event system that every pipeline listens to. The branch name and commit message are metadata that the pipeline reads to make decisions.

**What confused me:** Github is used as event system as well, previously i used to think, it is just repositry of codes

**What I will do tomorrow:** Write the first GitHub Actions CI workflow that runs these tests automatically on every push.

**Commit SHA:** ce13f4b213557f44a830ce30ffb88a74db44454f
